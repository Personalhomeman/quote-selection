    <h2>Blame</h4>
    <p>The <code>blame</code> feature in <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> describes the last modification to each line of a file, which generally displays the revision, author and time. This is helpful, for example, in tracking down when a feature was added, or which commit led to a particular bug.</p>

    <h2>Branch</h4>
    <p>A <code>branch</code> is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or <code>master</code> branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the <code>master</code> branch to publish your changes.</p>
