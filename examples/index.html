    <h4>Blame</h4>
    <p>The "blame" feature in Git describes the last modification to each line of a file, which generally displays the revision, author and time. This is helpful, for example, in tracking down when a feature was added, or which commit led to a particular bug.</p>

    <h4>Branch</h4>
    <p>A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or <code>master</code> branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the <code>master</code> branch to publish your changes.</p>
